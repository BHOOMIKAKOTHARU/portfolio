    <li><h1>Work Experience</h1></li>
        <h2>Research Intern</h2>
        <p>– Conducted in-depth research on biometric authentication systems, focusing on EEG (Electroencephalo
            gram) authentication as a novel approach.<br/>– Investigated various biometric recognition systems such as fingerprint, voice, iris, and face recognition,
            identifying their strengths and limitations.<br/>– Explored technical aspects of EEG including electrode placement, signal acquisition, amplification, and
            digital processing to enhance reliability and resistance to forgery.<br/>– Analyzed the efficacy of different classifier models (K-Nearest Neighbors, Auto Encoders, Support
            Vector Machines, XGBoost, and Convolutional Neural Networks) in biometric data classification, feature
            learning, and pattern recognition.<br/>– Contributed to the understanding of EEG’s significance in liveness detection and its potential applica
            tions in secure biometric systems.</p>
